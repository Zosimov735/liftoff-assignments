### Overview
The project we are creating is an e-commerce website that offers movies for sale to users. This is a flexible site, with potential for tons of different features depending on how far along we are going to get in development.

7. Search/Filter
### Technologies
JS/React + Java/Spring frameworks

### What I'll Have to Learn
Working with the API in Java is a challenge we face, parsing json in java is not something we worked with, so that will need to be learned. Spring security is a high priority for me to learn. If possible on top of spring sec I would like to learn and implement OAuth2. Working with a team. I think there will also be a lot of React that is available tpo be learned from this project even if I'm focusing on the backend portion.
